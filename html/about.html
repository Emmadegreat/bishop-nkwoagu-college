      <p>The School started on 9th September 2018 and the pioneer Manager is Ven Engr
        Kenechukwu Obinna & Mrs Ngozi Rose Onyemaobim who is serving as the Vicar from 13th
        January 2017 till date.
        Like a mustard seed the School started with very few students is growing to the
        glory of God.
        The Pioneer and the serving Principal is in the person of Mrs Tina Ahawike.
        She was posted to the new School by His Lordship Rt Rev Monday Chukwuma Nkwoagu
        JP to serve as the Principal. <br/>

        The pioneer teachers include Mr Chukwuma Mgbebu, Chidinma Oluebube Onyemaobim,
        Nmesoma Chiamaka Onyemaobim, Edwin Okechukwu a Corps Member, an Ivorian by name;
        Lawrence who was handling the French classes, Pastor Nnamdi Ihetu, Mrs Riches
        Efeomo now the Dean of Studies. Mrs Eucharia Onyebuchi latter joined the teaching crew.
        The Teaching Crew had since grown in number and qualifications overtime.
        The pioneer Senior Prefect of the School is in the person of Master Izuchukwu
        Israel Nwafor.

      </p>
      <p>
        In 2020 a Church Education Committee was constituted with Mr Chukwudi Uchenna
        Onwudiwe as the Committee Chairman, Dr Celestine Ukwu Nweke as the Secretary
        of the Committee, Hon Barr Kelechi Mbam, Prof Mrs Ann Nwigboji, Mrs Victoria
        Echefu, and Mrs Ndidi Okeke, as members. <br>
        It is worthy of note that our school
        is an approved center for external examinations.
      </p>
      <p>
        For excellence in learning the School has well developed standard Science
        Laboratories to enhance studies by practical experiments.
        School Library is well developed and equipped.
        The school currently has fourteen (14) classrooms, Principalâ€™s
        Office, a Staff Room, an Office for the Dean of Studies, an Office
        for the School Counselor, a 300-seat capacity hall for examinations
        and other school activities. <br>

        For a holistic learning module, the school has many sports facilities
        including Mini Football Field, Basket Ball Posts, Badminton Court,
        Volley Ball facilities and Table Tennis facilities are already in place.
        All these we believe to help our students blend their academic activities
        with extra-curriculum activities, because all work no play will make Jack
        a dull boy.
